      <h3 class="p-line-height p-normal pad-bottom-mobile">Governments that publish community-centered open data and information can go beyond transparency by co-designing and collaborating with community members to solve local challenges. Bringing open data to where residents are can help spark dialogues and inspire innovation. Data providers can use the strategies we’ve compiled below to apply open data for local impact.</h3>

      <h3>Collaboration playbooks</h3>
      <p>We’ve assembled the following playbooks to show you how cities and data-savvy organizations are collaborating with diverse stakeholder groups to build community relationships and apply open data. Each playbook was assembled in cooperation with host organizations, with step-by-step instructions for readers to test out strategies on their own.</p>

      <p>These playbooks are designed to provide a closer look at Tactical Data Engagement in real communities. Ideas included are built from real-world examples of events or strategies data providers have implemented to better connect residents to open data.</p>
      <p>Although we have included these playbooks on this <em>Action tools</em> page as tactics to use during the Action phase, consider using them during the Discovery phase as well. The tactics described in these playbooks are versatile — much like the rest of the TDE approach — and should be used creatively.</p> -->
